## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Organic Social emerged as the top-performing marketing channel by total users.** This channel contributed the highest volume of visitors to the website, indicating its strong potential in driving brand awareness and audience acquisition. This suggests a continued focus on Organic Social campaigns can maintain and potentially expand consistent user inflow.

- **When analyzing total sessions by channel, Organic Social again led in generating the highest number of sessions.** This confirms not only its user reach but also its ability to bring those users back, signaling effective ongoing engagement through social platforms.

- **Organic Video recorded the highest average engagement time per session.** This indicates that video content is highly effective in capturing and holding user attention, offering an opportunity to expand video-based content strategies for deeper audience interaction and retention.

- **Engagement rate distribution revealed that Organic Video also achieved the highest average engagement rate across channels.** This reaffirms video contentâ€™s capacity to foster meaningful user activity beyond passive visits, suggesting it's an impactful format for cultivating loyal and interested audiences.

- **A comparison of engaged vs. non-engaged sessions showed that while Organic Social brought in high traffic, Organic Video delivered a higher proportion of engaged sessions.** This points toward the quality-over-quantity principle in web traffic, highlighting the importance of content type in not just attracting but actively involving users.

- **Hourly traffic patterns identified 19:00 hrs as the peak traffic period across all channels.** Recognizing this high-activity window enables teams to strategically schedule campaigns, content releases, and product promotions to coincide with maximum audience availability, improving campaign reach and performance.

- **A weak positive correlation (+0.30) was observed between the number of sessions and engagement rate over time.** This indicates that while increased traffic slightly associates with higher engagement, traffic volume alone isn't a reliable indicator of engagement quality. Emphasis should remain on content relevance, targeting precision, and user experience optimization to enhance both traffic and meaningful interactions.
